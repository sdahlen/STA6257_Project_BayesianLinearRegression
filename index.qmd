## Week 2

### A tutorial on Bayesian Normal linear regression

This article provides a breakdown of how a Bayesian Linear Regression
works, detailing how one needs to take the priori knowledge/distribution
(which is previous knowledge) to get the posterior
knowledge/distribution (which is the priori knowledge with unknowns in
the data). This article gives an example of the priori and posteriori
knowledge by using the example of sonic nozzle calibration in metrology
and showing a graph of a posterior regression with a posterior
prediction. A sensitivity analysis was conducted and uses a
t-distribution for posterior predictive checks and checking residuals
for any inadequacies.

### Bayesian Linear Regression with skew-symmetric error distributions with applications to survival analysis

This article starts with explaining the Bayesian Linear Regression and
how if there is not a strong knowledge of priori, then noninformative
priori can be used instead and looks at different skew symmetric
distributions such as the skew-normal, skew-t, and the skew-logistic.
This article also details the different priors there are (Jeffreys,
Matching, Heuristic, and informative). Once it set up the previous
knowledge needed for Bayesian Linear Regression and skew-symmetric error
distributions, it goes into the example of the survival times of lung
cancer patients. By looking at the previously listed skew symmetric
distributions and comparing it to the scale mixture of normals (SMN),
the use of the skew symmetric distributions captures heterogeneity that
could not be capture by SMN and can explain residual error asymmetry.
